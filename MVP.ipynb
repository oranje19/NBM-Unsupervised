       "array([\"Gaming headsets and gaming go hand in hand with each other. If you know a serious gamer out there (or are on yourself) chances are they have a gaming headset. When one thinks about a gaming headset they think of 3 names, Turtle Beach, Triton or Astro. Along with those big names, you get a big price. Yes, these headsets are very nice, but what about the average gamer? Most gamers aren't looking for the absolute most elite gaming headset just to hear Atom Bomb Baby on Fallout 4 for the 1,000th time. The average gamer looks to spend about as much as a game on a headset that they hope works well enough that they shouldnt need to take out a loan for a headset. That is where PDP comes in with the LVL 5; a tough, yet good sounding stereo headset that works with both new gen systems out today.\\n\\nThe PDP LVL 5 looks to toughen up the inexpensive lineup coming in at only $50, yet somehow PDP included a few extras that aren't even included in their own lineup of flagship headsets. This review covers the Xbox One version of the headset, but if you would rather the Blue lights of the PS4 version, that is the only difference, so if you are a gamer on either system, please read on!\\n\\nUpon getting the package from PDP, I was surprised how well built the packaging was. Once again, PDP has made a tough, durable outer shell for the headset. My previously reviewed AG 9s were not this well packed so finding a less expensive headset this tightly enclosed surprised me. Upon cutting the two dot pieces of tape, I was onto the headset itself. Between two pieces of molded plastic (one clear and one black) was the LVL 5 headset along with the 3.5mm headphone jack (non-removable) and two AA batteries for the LED lights in which we will get into in a minute. Once the plastic was removed I noticed how hefty they were. While no, these headsets won't bog down your ears in long gaming sessions, they feel like they were made well enough to take a beating from those long days of Black Ops 3. From there I proceeded to put the included AA batteries in the left ear cup and started gaming straight away.\\n\\nOnce Fallout 4 started up I plugged the headset into my controller and noticed the sound was playing immediately without me turning the headset on. Surprisingly they were passively as well-meaning they don't need to be on to have music play through them. No worries about having batteries in those long gaming sessions! Great work on that one PDP. However, when I turned the headset on an explosion happened (a super mutant blew up a car a few meters from me) and BAM! The headset nearly rumbled off of my head! This little headset has a haptic bass feedback system that really rumbles your head, making explosions nearly come alive. I was caught off guard and loved the extra added immersion the headset gave me.\\n\\nf you are looking for a bass-heavy headset look no further; this is THE headset to buy. One thing to note however is that you do need AA batteries for this feature, so I recommend buying a 4 pack of rechargeable AA batteries (Duracell preferably). With the Bass feature turned up all the way Im on hour ten without a hint of the batteries dying. There are warnings before hand, so it doesnt die directly at the way so that is a nice addition. If however, your headset dies in the middle of an epic battle just turn the bass feature off on the left ear cup and you can listen to your games passively without the bass heavy feature, and in all honestly they sound just as great. While these do have just 40mm drivers, they sound great just in passive mode. One thing to look out for, however, is that when the bass feedback feature is on a sound levels drop like a brick. Passive mode makes things much louder, and Im not entirely certain why this would be. No, they do not have the crystal clear technology of the AG 9s they sound great for the price they are and they CAN go toe to toe with any one of my less expensive Turtle Beach headsets and they actually do sound better than my previous JBL headset I have come to love over the past few years. There are a few buttons on the sides of the ear cups for volume and muting of your game as well, but this only works on the console in which you buy the headset for, unfortunately.\\n\\nChatting with my brother over Xbox live proved to be a highlight for this headset. I have tried talking to him with my Bluetooth speaker playing right next to me, I tried whispering, I tried everything for him not to be able to hear me, but every time I came through clear and concise, if a bit softer than the loudness that were the AG 9s. These are a dream to chat with the non-removable mic, once you are done, just flip the microphone up and your voices is muted, flip them down and you are able to talk again.\\n\\nComfort is something every gamer needs in order to expect good immersion, we don't want to feel a lot of weight on our heads when we game and the last thing we want is a headache. The PDP LVL 5 has a good mix in durability and comfort. The on-ear hybrid type ear cups are comfortable and they do a great job with noise isolation from your surroundings. Once you have a game playing through the speaker, it is hard to distinguish any sound from just about any audio source within reason. Once the sliders are set up correctly for your ears the faux leather pads on the ear cups immediately block noise and are also very comfortable to wear. However, it is worth noting that your ears will sweat as there isn't much breathing room for your ears. This isn't horribly bad like the Triton 720+s are, but something to note for those long gaming sessions. The band is made out of the same material as the AG 9s and shouldnt present any problems in the future.\\n\\nAs stated before, this headset will work with both systems for gaming and voice chat. Both consoles will be able to use the haptic bass feedback system and you will be able to be called a noob on both systems through voice chat. No matter if you bought the PS4 version or the Xbox One version, both will be able to be used on both systems. This not only saves you from having to store two headsets but also saves you another $50. The lights on the side of the headset do NOT turn off unlike the AG 9s, this isn't nearly as noticeable while gaming at night however, so this shouldnt be a problem for gamers like the AG 9s LEDs were.\\n\\nOverall, this stereo gaming headset is impressive for the price. For the low cost of $50 you are getting a haptic feedback bass system, LED lights and a balanced audio experience when in passive mode. PDP really did a good job with this headset, while it isn't the best sound quality the LVL 5 fills the void between good and inexpensive gaming headsets.\\n\\nYou can find this review and more at my website Gamersftw.co.uk.\\n\\nI was given this product in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.\",\n",
       "       \"It's a great headset, but in my experience I have some annoyances that may or may not concern you. I should also state that I treat my equipment well, never throwing it down or something like that.\\n\\n1 ) headset jack will slightly but easily pull out of the dongle, which disables the mic but not the sound completely so you'll be unaware that you're muted.\\n\\n2) screws on the side of each headset overtime have loosened and fallen out, which helps keep the headset secure ( retightened myself )\\n\\n3 ) ear cushion has split, exposing a big portion of the memory foam and feels weird.\",\n",
       "       \"Just got my hands on this headset to pair with my new Bluetooth transceiver today. I'm pleased it arrived earlier than expected. I carefully unboxed the headset from the impressive packaging, and then flexed the band lightly to feel its tension before wearing it over my head. To my horror, the plastic housing on the left side of the ear piece cracked open, with the screws still intact. As a result, that ear piece became detached from the headset. I checked the internal structure and discovered all screw threads broke off from base. Very disappointed with the build quality. How's the sound quality on this thing? I can't tell you because I've never got to put it on. I think the plastic on this thing is becoming brittle due to aging. Returning for a refund now.\",\n",
       "       \"The headset itself is great.  Audio quality is clear, and it is the most comfortable headset that I've ever owned.  The ear cups do a good job of canceling noise out as well.  The microphone works great also, however a plastic piece broke off of it, leaving an exposed wire and a shaky, unstable mic.  Take a look at the attached picture if you want to see exactly what I'm talking about.  I have contacted Kingston customer service asking them to replace the mic since this headset comes with a 2 year warranty and am currently waiting to hear back from them.  I will update my review, and depending on how they handle this issue change my rating to either 1 or 5 stars.\\n\\nUpdate:  Kingston replaced the mic for free under warranty.  They sent it with 2 day shipping and didn't even require me to send the broken part back.  This was an example of great customer service and I can say that I am now very pleased overall with this purchase.\",\n",
       "       \"I've had this headset for less than 5 months and the mini USB connector that provides power to the base fell off its circuit board. I also frequently had issues with being unable to turn the headset off, thereby running the battery out when not in use, even though I kept the firmware and software up to date.\\n\\n  I really wanted to like these because they are comfortable and had good sound.\"],\n",
