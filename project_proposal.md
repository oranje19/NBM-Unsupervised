### Project Proposal

#### Question

In this project, I am gaining the overall impression of a Natural Language Processing to work together with the Marketing Team for a video game company. To do so,
I will recommend strategies to help the team target many customers with the lowest possible cost. In order to do so, I will be using historical customer reviews for
previous games and competitors' games. I will apply different NLP methods to acquire a deeper understanding of customer feedback and opinion.

#### Data Description

This project will use Amazon video games department reviews. [Here](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html) is the dataset.

The dataset consists of several items:
* ratings
* review description
* review title
* review time

#### Tools

* EDA in Python pandas and numpy
* scikit-learn for model
* matplotlib and seabord for visualization
* NLTK for NLP

#### MVP Goal

The MVP will consist a few plots of NLP methods and some charts on the dataset.
