## Video Games Reviews Sentiment Analysis

The goal of this project is to predict video games products reviews sentiment based on the customer reviews.

To start exploring this goal, I used Python pandas to do data cleaning/manipulation. Then I used CountVectorizer with english stop words to create a list of corpus. Further on, I picked the NMF model for my project and implemented 15 different components for my topics.

Currently I am working on my topic interpretation before finalizing my sentiment score based on the user reviews for each product in the dataset. Once everything is set, it will show many different EDAs and charts for the reviews sentiment analysis.
